### Before submitting your issue or feature request

1. ***This is not Anbernic Stock Emuelec or 351Elec.***  ArkOS is a different distribution from those systems and will have differing features.  The only somewhat similarity is that they both use EmulationStation as a frontend.  Even with that, the versions of EmulationStation that's used in between ArkOS and Anbernic Emuelec/351Elec is different with different capabilities.  If there are features you prefer with Anbernic Emuelec/351Elec, just use those distributions instead.  The choice is yours.
