## Install info

For ArkOS on supported devices, PortMaster was included with a recent online update.  You can locate it in the Options > Tools menu. \
If you don't have PortMaster there or need to install it manually, you can do the following:
* Place the PortMaster folder in /roms/tools.
   * On the RG351V, if SD2 is being used for roms, installation must be in /roms2/tools/. 
* Run PortMaster from ArkOS Options > Tools > PortMaster menu.

## Do I have to use PortMaster to install ports?

No.  You can simply go to the ports folder on the ArkOS github (https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/tree/main/ports), find the .zip of the port you want, download it and unzip the contents of it to the /roms/ports folder.  NB : on the RG351V, if SD2 is being used for roms, unzip the port to the /roms2/ports folder instead. \
* Be aware that SuperTux is not available from this repo due to Github's file size restriction.  You can download it from this location instead: http://139.196.213.206/arkos/ports/SuperTux.zip
