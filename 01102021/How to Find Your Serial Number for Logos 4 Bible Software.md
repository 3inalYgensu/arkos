You can also find your serial number in your Logos account page, under the Orders section. However, if you have lost or misplaced your serial number, or if you have installed Logos 4 on a new device and need to enter it again, there are some ways to retrieve it.
 
## Method 1: Check Your Logos Installation Folder
 
One of the easiest ways to find your serial number for Logos 4 is to check your Logos installation folder on your computer. This is where Logos stores some of the files and settings related to your software. To access this folder, follow these steps:
 
1. Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) and navigate to the following location: `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Logos4` (Windows) or `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Logos4` (Mac). Replace `username` with your actual username.
2. Look for a file named `Logos4.lsb`. This is a binary file that contains some information about your Logos installation, including your serial number.
3. Open the file with a text editor, such as Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). You may need to change the file extension to `.txt` first.
4. Search for the word `SerialNumber` in the file. You should see something like this: `<SerialNumber>1234-5678-9012-3456</SerialNumber>`. The string of numbers between the tags is your serial number.
5. Copy and paste your serial number into Logos 4 when prompted.
